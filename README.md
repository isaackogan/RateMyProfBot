# Warning: Preferably use the official API instead of this bot

RateMyProfessors offers an official GraphQL API.  It's probably wiser to use that API instead of a scraper bot like this one.  If you do a Google search, you can find one or more simple wrapper scripts which might make the official API easier to use.

If you insist on using a scraper bot, it might be a very good idea to ask the website's support team in advance for permission to scrape.  If you scrape without permission, they can block you without warning.  Then you might not even be able to use the website using a Web browser, even for normal low-volume personal use.
